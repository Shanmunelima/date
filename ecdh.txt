Yes, the code provided is for performing image encryption and decryption using the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key agreement protocol. 

Here's how it works:

1. The code generates key pairs for both Alice and Bob using the Elliptic Curve algorithm.
2. It performs the key agreement process between Alice and Bob using the ECDH algorithm.
3. After generating a shared secret between Alice and Bob, it uses that shared secret as a symmetric encryption key.
4. Then, it reads an image file, encrypts its contents using AES encryption with the shared symmetric key, and writes the encrypted data to another file.
5. Later, it reads the encrypted image file, decrypts it using the same symmetric key, and writes the decrypted data to another file.

The encryption and decryption operations are based on the AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) algorithm with ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode and PKCS5Padding for padding. The key used for AES encryption is derived from the shared secret generated by ECDH.

So, yes, this code demonstrates image encryption and decryption using ECDH.
