

File Encryption and Decryption:

Data owner encrypts files using AES before uploading them to the public cloud. The encrypted files are stored securely within the public cloud's storage infrastructure.
Upon decryption request from authorized users, the private cloud retrieves the encrypted file from the public cloud and decrypts it using the appropriate AES key.

File Retrieval via Keyword Search:

Data owner uploads files along with associated keywords to the private cloud.
Private cloud securely stores the keywords and metadata associated with the files.
Authorized data users send keyword requests to the private cloud for file retrieval.
Private cloud searches for files based on keywords provided by the user and retrieves the corresponding encrypted files from the public cloud.

Access Control and Time-Limited Sharing:

Private cloud manages access control by validating the identity of both data owners and users.
Private cloud shares the file name(s) along with a time limit for downloading the file(s) to authorized users.
Data users must download the file within the specified time limit, enforced by the private cloud.
After the time limit expires, access to the file(s) is revoked.

Security Measures:

AES encryption ensures the confidentiality and integrity of files stored in the public cloud.
Private cloud manages access control and user authentication to prevent unauthorized access to files and sensitive metadata.
Regular security assessments and updates are conducted to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in both the private and public cloud components.
Trap Door Mechanism:

Time-limited sharing implemented by the private cloud acts as a trapdoor mechanism, providing temporary access to files based on specific conditions (e.g., keyword request and time limit).


Data Owner Module:

This module represents the interface or application used by data owners to upload files and associated keywords to the system.
It should provide functionalities for encrypting files using AES before uploading them to the public cloud.
This module needs to interact securely with both the private and public cloud components.

Data User Module:

This module represents the interface or application used by data users to search for and retrieve files based on keywords.
It should provide functionalities for sending keyword requests to the private cloud and downloading files within the specified time limit.
It also needs to interact securely with the private cloud component.

Private Cloud Module:

This module manages access control, keyword searches, and file retrievals within the private cloud infrastructure.
It should include components for user authentication, keyword indexing, and file retrieval.
This module interacts with both the data owner and data user modules to validate identities and facilitate file transfers.

Public Cloud Module:

This module represents the cloud storage infrastructure where encrypted files are stored.
It should provide secure storage and retrieval of files, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.
This module interacts mainly with the data owner module for file uploads and the private cloud module for file retrievals.

In today's digital landscape, the exponential growth of data has brought to light the pressing need for robust systems that can effectively manage and secure sensitive information. Traditional approaches to data storage and retrieval often struggle to keep pace with the evolving threats of cyber attacks and the increasing complexity of data access requirements. As organizations grapple with the challenge of safeguarding their data while ensuring efficient access, there arises a demand for innovative solutions that can reconcile these seemingly conflicting objectives.

This introduces a forward-thinking system designed to address the shortcomings of traditional data management methods by offering a comprehensive approach to file encryption, storage, and retrieval. At its core, the system leverages cutting-edge encryption techniques to protect files from unauthorized access, ensuring that sensitive information remains confidential even when stored in the cloud. By incorporating keyword-based retrieval mechanisms, users can swiftly locate and access files, streamlining workflows and enhancing productivity. Moreover, the integration of both private and public cloud infrastructures provides scalability and flexibility, allowing the system to adapt to the evolving needs of modern organizations.

Through the implementation of this innovative system, organizations can achieve a harmonious balance between security and accessibility, enabling them to confidently manage their data while mitigating the risks associated with unauthorized access and data breaches. By embracing the possibilities offered by advanced technology, organizations can unlock new opportunities for collaboration, innovation, and growth in the digital era.



objective
The objective is to create a system that securely encrypts, stores, and retrieves files based on keyword searches with access control. It aims to enhance security, efficiency, and scalability compared to traditional methods, while remaining adaptable to future technological advancements.



Existing Method

In the past, traditional file storage and retrieval systems often relied on centralized servers or local storage solutions. These systems typically stored files without encryption, leading to potential security vulnerabilities. Moreover, file retrieval in such systems often relied on manual searches or hierarchical folder structures, making it cumbersome and time-consuming to find specific files, especially in large datasets.

One major disadvantage of these old methods is the lack of robust security measures. Since files were often stored without encryption, they were vulnerable to unauthorized access and data breaches. Additionally, the reliance on manual searches or rigid folder structures made it challenging to efficiently locate and retrieve files, leading to decreased productivity and potential errors.

Furthermore, centralized storage solutions lacked scalability and flexibility, making it difficult to accommodate growing data volumes or adapt to changing business needs. As a result, organizations faced challenges in managing their data effectively and ensuring timely access for authorized users.

Overall, the old existing methods of file storage and retrieval suffered from security vulnerabilities, inefficiencies in file searching, and limitations in scalability and flexibility, highlighting the need for more robust and modern solutions to address these shortcomings.

Disadvantages:

Security Vulnerabilities: Storing files without encryption left them vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.

Inefficient Retrieval: Manual searches or rigid folder structures made it cumbersome and time-consuming to find specific files, particularly in large datasets, leading to decreased productivity.
